# Contributing to jjigit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **jjigit**!  
This project aims to build a real-time polling and debate platform, with an AI module responsible for generating discussion topics using lightweight LLMs such as Gemma 2B.

This guide describes how to contribute specifically to the AI module and how to maintain a consistent workflow across the project.

## 📌 General Principles

- All work must follow the workflow:  
  **Issue → Branch → Commit → Pull Request → Review → Merge**
- Do **not** push directly to the `main` branch.
- Every change, small or large, must go through a Pull Request (PR).
- Keep commits clean, meaningful, and related to a single logical change.

## 🧩 1. Creating an Issue

Before writing any code, create an Issue in the repository’s **Issues** tab.

Your Issue should include:
- What you plan to add or fix  
- Why it is needed  
- Any context or related files  

After creating the Issue:
- Assign it to yourself (**Assignees**)  
- Add a relevant label (e.g., `ai`, `enhancement`, `bug`, `docs`)

**Example Issue title:**

```text
Add LLM-based topic generation using Gemma 2B
